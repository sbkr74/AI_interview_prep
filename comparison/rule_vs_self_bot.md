**Rule-Based Chatbot:**

1. **Architecture:** Rule-based chatbots rely on predefined rules and decision trees to handle conversations. These rules are created by developers or domain experts and involve matching user input with predefined patterns to determine responses.

2. **Flexibility:** Limited flexibility. The chatbot can only respond to inputs it has been explicitly programmed to understand. If a user's query doesn't match a rule, the bot may fail to provide a meaningful response.

3. **Development:** Easier to develop but time-consuming for complex scenarios. The logic must be explicitly defined, making it challenging to scale for diverse or unanticipated queries.

4. **Learning:** No learning capability. The bot's knowledge is static unless manually updated by developers.

5. **Examples:** FAQ bots, customer service bots with structured interactions.

**Self-Learning (AI-based) Chatbot:**

1. **Architecture:** Self-learning chatbots typically use machine learning, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to understand and generate responses. They often rely on models like neural networks, including transformers like GPT.

2. **Flexibility:** Highly flexible. These bots can handle a wide range of inputs and can generalize from past interactions, making them more adaptable to varied queries.

3. **Development:** More complex to develop. Requires training data, model tuning, and continuous monitoring to ensure quality. The bot's performance depends on the quality and quantity of training data.

4. **Learning:** Capable of learning from interactions over time. Some models use supervised learning (trained on labeled data), while others might incorporate reinforcement learning or unsupervised techniques to improve.

5. **Examples:** Virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and advanced customer service bots.

**Technical Key Points:**

- **Rule-based:** Deterministic, uses regular expressions, pattern matching, if-else conditions.
- **Self-learning:** Probabilistic, leverages NLP, deep learning models, can use large language models (LLMs) like GPT.
