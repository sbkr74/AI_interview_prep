## Regularization
<b> Regularization is a set of methods for reducing overfitting in machine learning models. Typically, regularization trades a marginal decrease in training accuracy for an increase in generalizability.</b>
Regularization encompasses a range of techniques to correct for overfitting in machine learning models. As such, regularization is a method for increasing a model’s generalizability—that is, it’s ability to produce accurate predictions on new datasets. Regularization provides this increased generalizability at the sake of increased training error. In other words, regularization methods typically lead to less accurate predictions on training data but more accurate predictions on test data.
Role Of Regularization

In Python, Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning too much importance to individual features or coefficients.
Let’s explore some more detailed explanations about the role of Regularization in Python:

    Complexity Control: Regularization helps control model complexity by preventing overfitting to training data, resulting in better generalization to new data.
    Preventing Overfitting: One way to prevent overfitting is to use regularization, which penalizes large coefficients and constrains their magnitudes, thereby preventing a model from becoming overly complex and memorizing the training data instead of learning its underlying patterns.
    Balancing Bias and Variance: Regularization can help balance the trade-off between model bias (underfitting) and model variance (overfitting) in machine learning, which leads to improved performance.
    Feature Selection: Some regularization methods, such as L1 regularization (Lasso), promote sparse solutions that drive some feature coefficients to zero. This automatically selects important features while excluding less important ones.
    Handling Multicollinearity: When features are highly correlated (multicollinearity), regularization can stabilize the model by reducing coefficient sensitivity to small data changes.
    Generalization: Regularized models learn underlying patterns of data for better generalization to new data, instead of memorizing specific examples.
