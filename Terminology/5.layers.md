### Professional Definition (For Interview):
In machine learning, a "layer" refers to a fundamental building block of neural networks, particularly in deep learning models. Layers are used to process and transform input data through a series of operations, typically involving mathematical functions. 

There are several types of layers:
- **Input Layer**: The first layer, which receives the raw data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that perform computations and transformations. These layers are responsible for extracting features and learning complex patterns in the data.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer that produces the result, like a prediction or classification.

Each layer consists of neurons (also called nodes) that apply weights to the inputs and pass the results through an activation function. The combined effect of multiple layers allows the model to learn and make decisions based on the data provided. The depth and complexity of these layers are what give rise to the term "deep learning."
