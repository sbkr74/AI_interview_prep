### Professional Definition (For Interview):
A **loss function** (also known as a cost function or objective function) is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output of a model and the actual target value. It quantifies how well or poorly the model is performing by producing a single number—called the loss—that represents the error in the model's predictions.

- **Purpose**: The loss function guides the training process by providing a measure that the learning algorithm can minimize. During training, the model's parameters (such as weights in a neural network) are adjusted to minimize the loss function, thereby improving the model's accuracy on the task.

- **Types of Loss Functions**:
  - **Regression Tasks**: Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - **Classification Tasks**: Common loss functions include Cross-Entropy Loss and Hinge Loss.
