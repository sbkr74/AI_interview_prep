### Professional Definition (For Interview):
Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is an algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It is a supervised learning technique that involves two main steps: forward propagation and backward propagation.

- **Forward Propagation**: In this step, input data passes through the network layer by layer, with each layer performing specific computations on the data and producing an output. The final output is compared to the actual target (or label) to calculate the loss or error.

- **Backward Propagation**: This is the key part of the algorithm. The error calculated during forward propagation is propagated backward through the network, layer by layer. During this backward pass, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. These gradients indicate how much the weights contribute to the error.

Using these gradients, the algorithm updates the weights using an optimization method (e.g., gradient descent) to minimize the loss function. This process is repeated over multiple iterations (epochs) until the network's predictions are sufficiently accurate.
