### Underfitting
A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when a model is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively result in poor performance both on the training and testing data. In simple terms, an underfit modelâ€™s are inaccurate, especially when applied to new, unseen examples. It mainly happens when we uses very simple model with overly simplified assumptions. To address underfitting problem of the model, we need to use more complex models, with enhanced feature representation, and less regularization.
