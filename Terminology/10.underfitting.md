### Underfitting
A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when a model is too simple to capture data complexities. It represents the inability of the model to learn the training data effectively result in poor performance both on the training and testing data. In simple terms, an underfit modelâ€™s are inaccurate, especially when applied to new, unseen examples. It mainly happens when we uses very simple model with overly simplified assumptions. To address underfitting problem of the model, we need to use more complex models, with enhanced feature representation, and less regularization.

<b>Note: The underfitting model has High bias and low variance.</b>

### Reasons for Underfitting

The model is too simple, So it may be not capable to represent the complexities in the data.
The input features which is used to train the model is not the adequate representations of underlying factors influencing the target variable.
    The size of the training dataset used is not enough.
    Excessive regularization are used to prevent the overfitting, which constraint the model to capture the data well.
    Features are not scaled.
