# Topics
## 1. Deep-learning
-   Nueral Networks(ANN)
    - Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): The simplest type where information moves in one direction from input to output.

    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Primarily used for image and speech recognition.
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Suitable for sequence data like time series or natural language processing.
    - Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM): A type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies.
    - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): A variant of LSTM with a simpler structure.
    - Autoencoders: Used for unsupervised learning, mainly for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): Consist of two networks (generator and discriminator) that compete to generate realistic data.
    - Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN): Used for function approximation and pattern recognition.
    - Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN): Used for classification problems.
    - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): Used for unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional representation of the input space.
