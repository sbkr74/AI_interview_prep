In Computer Vision (CV), traditional models refer to techniques and algorithms that were widely used before the advent of deep learning and neural networks. These models rely on manually engineered features and simpler machine learning algorithms. Here are some key components of traditional models in CV:

### 1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - **Edge Detection:** Techniques like Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian filters are used to detect edges in images, which are important features for identifying shapes and objects.
   - **Corner Detection:** Algorithms like Harris Corner Detector are used to find points in the image where the intensity changes significantly in multiple directions, which is useful for matching features between images.
   - **Texture Analysis:** Methods like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gabor filters are used to analyze textures in images, which can be important for tasks like face recognition and object classification.

### 2. **Feature Descriptors:**
   - **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):** SIFT detects and describes local features in images, which are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes.
   - **SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features):** SURF is a faster alternative to SIFT and is also used for detecting and describing local features.
   - **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients):** HOG is used to describe the distribution of gradient orientations in localized portions of an image, often used in object detection.

### 3. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, non-parametric method used for classification tasks by comparing the features of a new image to the stored features of labeled images.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs are used to classify images by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.
   - **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for classification or regression tasks.

### 4. **Image Processing Techniques:**
   - **Morphological Operations:** Techniques like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing are used to process binary or grayscale images, often for removing noise or separating objects in an image.
   - **Thresholding:** Used to segment images into different regions based on pixel intensity values.

### 5. **Template Matching:**
   - A technique where a template (a small image or shape) is slid over a larger image to find regions that match the template.

### Use Cases:
Traditional models are still used in some applications, especially where computational efficiency and interpretability are important, such as in real-time systems, embedded devices, or when working with smaller datasets where deep learning may not be feasible.
