### 1. Intersection over Union (IoU)
**IoU** is a metric used to measure the overlap between two bounding boxes: the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.

- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}
  \]
  Where:
  - **Area of Overlap:** The area where the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box intersect.
  - **Area of Union:** The total area covered by both the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.

- **Interpretation:**
  - **IoU = 1:** Perfect overlap, meaning the predicted bounding box exactly matches the ground truth.
  - **IoU = 0:** No overlap at all.
  - **IoU > 0.5:** Generally considered a good prediction, though the threshold can vary depending on the task.

### 2. mean Average Precision (mAP)
**mAP** is a comprehensive metric used to evaluate the performance of an object detection model across different classes and IoU thresholds. It combines **Precision** and **Recall** to summarize the model’s ability to detect objects.

- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
  
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.

**Steps to Calculate mAP:**
1. **Calculate Precision-Recall (P-R) curve:** For each class, plot Precision vs. Recall at different IoU thresholds.
   
2. **Compute Average Precision (AP):** The area under the P-R curve for each class. It’s the average precision value across different recall levels.
   
3. **Calculate mAP:** Take the mean of AP values across all classes.

- **Formula:**
  \[
  \text{mAP} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{AP}_i
  \]
  Where \( N \) is the number of classes, and \( \text{AP}_i \) is the Average Precision for class \( i \).

- **Interpretation:**
  - **mAP = 1:** Perfect model, indicating perfect precision and recall.
  - **Higher mAP values** indicate better overall performance of the model.

These metrics are crucial for understanding how well an object detection model is performing and are widely used in benchmarks like COCO and PASCAL VOC.
