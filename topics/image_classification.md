**Image classification** is a task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label or category to an input image based on its visual content. In other words, given an image, an image classification model predicts the class or type of object(s) present in that image.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Classes/Labels**: These are predefined categories that the model can predict. For example, in a cat vs. dog classifier, the possible classes are "cat" and "dog."

2. **Model**: A machine learning model (often a neural network like a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN) is trained on a dataset containing images labeled with their respective classes. The model learns to recognize patterns and features associated with each class.

3. **Training**: The model is trained using a dataset where each image is paired with its correct label. The model iteratively adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predicted labels and the actual labels.

4. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can be used to classify new, unseen images by predicting the most likely label based on the patterns it has learned.

5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is typically evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, as mentioned earlier.

### Example:
Consider an image classification task where the goal is to identify whether an image contains a car, a bicycle, or a truck. The process involves:
- **Training**: The model is trained on thousands of labeled images (e.g., images of cars, bicycles, and trucks).
- **Prediction**: Given a new image, the model analyzes the image and predicts whether it is a car, bicycle, or truck.
- **Output**: The model outputs the predicted label (e.g., "bicycle") along with confidence scores indicating how sure the model is about its prediction.

### Applications:
Image classification is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Object recognition**: Identifying specific objects in images (e.g., recognizing faces, animals, or vehicles).
- **Medical imaging**: Classifying medical images for diagnosis (e.g., detecting tumors in X-rays or MRIs).
- **Content moderation**: Automatically identifying inappropriate content in images uploaded to social media platforms.
- **Autonomous vehicles**: Recognizing road signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles for safe navigation.

In summary, image classification is a foundational task in computer vision that involves categorizing images into predefined classes based on their visual features.
