Here's an overview of the three types of machine learning:

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- **How it works**: During training, the model makes predictions on the training data, and the predictions are compared to the actual labels. The model adjusts its parameters to minimize the error between its predictions and the true labels.
- **Examples**:
  - **Classification**: Assigning labels to emails as "spam" or "not spam."
  - **Regression**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
  
### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Definition**: Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that does not have labeled outcomes. The model tries to find patterns, relationships, or structure in the data.
- **How it works**: The model looks for patterns in the data, such as grouping similar data points together (clustering) or reducing the dimensionality of the data.
- **Examples**:
  - **Clustering**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information (e.g., PCA).

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Definition**: Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes.
- **How it works**: The agent takes actions in an environment, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
- **Examples**:
  - **Game Playing**: Teaching an AI to play chess by rewarding it for winning.
  - **Robotics**: Training a robot to navigate a maze by rewarding it for reaching the end.

Each type of learning is suited for different types of problems, and sometimes, a combination of them can be used to achieve the best results.
